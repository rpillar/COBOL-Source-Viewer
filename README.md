Currently the script reads a COBOL source file and wraps it in HTML thereby allowing it to be viewed in a web browser. As it was written quite a long time ago a lot of updates are required to make the processing more sensible.
Setup

###Create folders

Create the appropriate folder structure :-

    mkdir ./source/code**  
    mkdir ./source/copy**  
    mkdir ./html/code**  
    mkdir ./html/copy**  
    
Place all your COBOL code in the ./source/code folder and the COBOL copybook code in the ./source/copy folder.
